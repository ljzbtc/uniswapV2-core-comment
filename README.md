# Uniswap Code Study and Commentary

## Overview

This repository contains an in-depth study and commentary on the Uniswap protocol's smart contracts. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Uniswap's implementation, focusing on code analysis, explanations, and learning notes. Notably, the contracts in this repository have been updated to compile with Solidity version 0.8, incorporating the latest language features and optimizations.

## Contents

- Annotated Uniswap smart contracts (upgraded to Solidity 0.8)
- Detailed explanations of key functions and mechanisms
- Analysis of core concepts (e.g., constant product formula, liquidity provision, fee calculation)
- Comparisons between different versions (V2 vs V3)
- Learning notes and insights

## Key Features

- Line-by-line comments on critical parts of the code
- Explanations of complex algorithms and mathematical concepts
- Diagrams and flowcharts for visualizing contract interactions
- Examples of typical scenarios (e.g., swaps, liquidity addition/removal)
- Discussion of design decisions and their implications
- Upgraded contracts compatible with Solidity 0.8, showcasing modern syntax and built-in overflow checks
